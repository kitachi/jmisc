METS Java toolkit examples
Copyright (c) 2003-2005 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College

The three example applications, Write, Validate, and Copy, can be tested as
follows:

  Makefile
  java -classpath .:../bin/mets.jar Write  > out.xml
  java -classpath .:../bin/mets.jar Validate out.xml
  java -classpath .:../bin/mets.jar Copy     out.xml > copy.xml
  diff out.xml copy.xml

The Write application procedurally creates an in-memory representation
of a METS file and then serializes it out to standard output.

The Copy application de-serializes an existing METS file into an
in-memory representation and then serializes it out to standard output.

The METS files created by both applications, out.xml and copy.xml,
should be identical.
